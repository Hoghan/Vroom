# Vroom

Vroom is a 3D game engine made with OpenGL. It is a personal project I'm doing for fun to improve myself as a C++ developer.
This project has been reset, the old version in 2D with SFML is still available in branch "V1".

## Building project

Building has only been tested on Windows.
In repository root folder, open a terminal and type :

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build . --config [Release|Debug]
ctest # If you want to run unit tests
```

Output files will be written in Vroom/build/[Project]/[config]/ folder, where [Project] is Vroom or Sandbox, and config is Release or Debug.

You may need to copy the Resources/ folder by hand, from the repository root to the same directory than the Sandbox executable.
CMake does it by itself on vscode, I and did not take the time to fix it for command line.
